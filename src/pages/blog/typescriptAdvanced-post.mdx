Each one of us wants to be better from day to day and today's story is about making us better.
We will talk about typescript and more advanced topics that should help us write better code in the future.

## As const assertions

Assertions are a way to make variables more specific regardless of their inferred type. One of them is
as const assertions, which make our variable readonly. It is especially valuable in combination with arrays.

```js
const numbers = [1,2,3] as const;
//Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property.ts(2540)
numbers[0] = 1;
```

Above we want to change the value of the first element of the array. The compilator will raise the error. The same
situation will be with objects.

```js
const test = {test: 'test'} as const;
//Cannot assign to 'test' because it is a read-only property.ts(2540)
test.test = 'test2';
```

We have to be aware that it is only in compilation time, at runtime we still can change the value,
to be sure that the object is immutable we have to call also `Object.freeze` method.

## Satisfies Keyword

Sometimes we want to ensure that a specific object contains only desirable elements, but we want to let the typescript infer a specific value.

```js
type Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";
type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number]
const colors: Record<Colors, string | RGB> = {
    red: "red",
    green: "green",
    blue: [0,0,255]
}
//Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | RGB'. Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'RGB'.ts(2339)
const testString = colors.red.toUpperCase();
const testArray = colors.blue;
```

The above example will raise an error because typescript doesn't know if the property is a string or array. To fix this we can do the casting.

```js
const testString = (colors.red as string).toUpperCase();
```

but it doesn't look good. What we can do instead is to use **satisfies** Keyword.

```js
type Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";
type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number]
const colors = {
    red: "red",
    green: "green",
    blue: [0,0,255]
} satisfies Record<Colors, string | RGB>

const testString = colors.red.toUpperCase();
const testArray = colors.blue;
```

in that way we are only checking if the object colors is built using available types only at the creation time.

## Generic Types

Generic types allow you to write functions and classes that can work with multiple data types.

```js
function getAge<T>(age: T): T {
  return age;
}

const testString = getAge("25").toUpperCase();
const testNumber = getAge(25);
```

```js
class Pair<T,V> {
    private first: T;
    private second: V;
    constructor(first: T, second: V){
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }
    getValues(){
        return `${this.first} ${this.second}`
    }
}

const pair = new Pair<string, string>("first", "second");
const pair2 = new Pair<number, number>(1, 2);
```

We can constraint generic to a specific group of objects using **extends** Keyword.

```js
interface Point {
    x: number,
    y: number
}

function getCoordinates<T extends Point>(value: T): string {
    return `${value.x} ${value.y}`;
  }

const test1 = getCoordinates({width: 200, x: 3, y: 3});
//Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'width' does not exist in type 'Point'.ts(2345)
const tes2 = getCoordinates({width: 100, x: 30});
```

And more complex example with the keyof operator that returns the keys of the given object.

```js
function getProperty<Type, Key extends keyof Type>(obj: Type, key: Key) {
    return obj[key];
  }

let x = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };

getProperty(x, "a");
//Argument of type '"m"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"a" | "b" | "c" | "d"'.ts(2345)
getProperty(x, "m");
```

## Utility types

Some more useful Utility types in typescript.

- **Partial**

Makes properties optional.

```js
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email: string;
}

function createUser(user: Partial<User>): User {
  return {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    ...user,
  };
}

const newUser = createUser({ name: "Jane Doe" });
```

- **Readonly**

Makes properties set to readonly. We can accomplish the same behavior with **as const** Keyword.

```js
interface Todo {
  title: string;
}

const todo: Readonly<Todo> = {
  title: "Delete inactive users",
};

// Cannot assign to 'title' because it is a read-only property.
todo.title = "Hello";
```

- **Pick**

Pick specific properties from the type and create a new type.

```js
interface Todo {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

type TodoPreview = Pick<Todo, "title" | "completed">;

const todo: TodoPreview = {
  title: "Clean room",
  completed: false,
};
```

- **Omit**

Omit specific properties and create a new type.

```js
interface Todo {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

type Description = Omit<Todo, "title" | "completed">;

const todo: Description = {
  description: "Clean room desc",
};
```
